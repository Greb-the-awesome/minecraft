# minecraft

this is a repo where I put the code that I made for making minecraft in pyOpenGL.

https://github.com/Greb-the-awesome/minecraft/blob/a92fac6e895925670cd5a705f16e7f5b3b7cf907/minecraft.py this is the main bulk of the code.

**e.py** was one of my early experiments with object oriented programming, when I wasnt familiar with the concept.
(oh and then I used it for trying out multithreading)

btw i gave up cos pyOpenGL is like s l o w
